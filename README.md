## Status

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WITH SEVERAL FEATURES STILL MISSING.**

## Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with Obsidian v0.15.0 and above.

## Installation

To install community plugins, make sure _safe mode_ is turned off in Obsidian's settings.

### Obsidian

The plugin is not yet available in Obsidian, because it is in beta. Please use BRAT to install the plugin, or install manually as described below.

<!---->
<!-- - Go to Settings > Community Plugins > Browse -->

### Manual

2. Extract the plugin folder from the zip to your vault's plugins folder: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/`. _Note: On some machines, the `.obsidian` folder may be hidden. On macOS, you should be able to press `Command+Shift+Dot` to show the folder in Finder._
